We will explore how (Gen)AI is starting to change the landscape of undergraduate chemistry education, and discuss its applications in chemistry teaching, alongside the benefits and challenges associated with its use.  \n\nWhile some Chemistry departments have been early adopters in using (Gen)AI in chemistry teaching, we are aware of others that are yet to incorporate (Gen)AI into their curriculum. This workshop will therefore provide case study examples while also providing opportunities for wider discussion on the topic.

The content of Chemistry education research (CER) ranges from understanding the history and philosophy of chemistry, which guides on us how chemistry knowledge was developed, to the application of emerging technologies and tools for more effective teaching and learning of chemistry. CER has grown as a field substantially over the past 60 years but is still a relatively young subdiscipline of chemistry. Although substantial progress has been made in identifying evidence-based strategies to support the teaching and learning of chemistry, we have yet to realize widespread systemic change regarding how chemistry is taught at the secondary school and tertiary levels. Connecting chemistry educators at the secondary education level with chemistry education researchers in academia has never been more vitally needed, and yet these groups are still frustratingly divided.","URL":"https://iccecrice2026.org/","Location_Country":"Türkiye","Location_City":"Erzurum","Location_Instiution":"ICCE & ECRICE","Registration Deadline":"2026-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","Mode":"In-person"},{"Entry":"6","Type":"Conference","Start Date":"2026-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","End Date":"2026-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","Title":"Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE)","Description":"The Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE) is a meeting sponsored by the Division of Chemical Education (DivCHED) of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The conference welcomes chemistry educators from around the globe and who operate in all education sectors (academia/government/industry) and levels (primary, secondary, two-year and four-year undergraduate, and graduate/postdoctoral).\n\nThe BCCE helps chemistry educators make connections with colleagues and friends who are dedicated to the teaching and learning of chemistry. The conference provides educators with opportunities for interacting with colleagues in formal and informal settings and can be an excellent source for ideas, inspiration, and materials for those both new to chemistry education and those who have years of experience.","URL":"https://conferences.union.wisc.edu/bcce2026/","Location_Country":"USA","Location_City":"Madison, Wisconsin","Location_Instiution":"University of Wisconsin–Madison","Registration Deadline":"","Mode":"In-person"},{"Entry":"7","Type":"Meeting","Start Date":"2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","End Date":"2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","Title":"Methods in Chemistry Education Research (MICER)","Description":"Methods in Chemistry Education Research (MICER) is an annual meeting focussing on the how to of education research.","URL":"https://micerportal.wordpress.com/","Location_Country":"UK","Location_City":"Edinburgh","Location_Instiution":"Edinburgh Napier University","Registration Deadline":"","Mode":"In-person"},{"Entry":"8","Type":"Conference","Start Date":"2026-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","End Date":"2026-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","Title":"Assessment in Higher Education","Description":"The globally highly-regarded annual Assessment in Higher Education conference will once more welcome delegates to Manchester in 2026.

A UN report published in 2024 notes that “intensifying, interconnected challenges continue to endanger the realization” of the seventeen sustainable development goals identified by the UN Sustainability Conference twelve years ago in Rio de Janeiro.  This is especially true in education, which the report correctly terms “the bedrock of sustainable development.”   It notes the negative effects of the COVID epidemic, regional conflicts, climate shock, and economic turmoil and paints a picture of a planet struggling to make progress towards them. While the big picture may be less than perfect, there is still much cause for hope, as we strive towards a better future.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the International Conference on Improving University Teaching seeks to address the challenge of sustainability, equity, and innovation as they affect higher education. In particular, we are exploring how to prepare students for a “VUCA world” in which they will have to contend with multiple challenges, while at the same time ensuring their wellbeing—and that of all academic staff—in the present. By definition, a future subject to uncertainty and ambiguity will require flexibility and adaptability on the part of students.","URL":"https://iutconference.com/","Location_Country":"UK","Location_City":"London","Location_Instiution":"University of Westminster","Registration Deadline":"","Mode":"Hybrid"},{"Entry":"10","Type":"Conference","Start Date":"2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","End Date":"2025-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","Title":"Horizons in STEM Higher Education Conference","Description":"Welcome to the 2025 UK Horizons in STEM Higher Education Conference website.
