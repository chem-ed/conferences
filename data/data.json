We will explore how (Gen)AI is starting to change the landscape of undergraduate chemistry education, and discuss its applications in chemistry teaching, alongside the benefits and challenges associated with its use.â€¯ \n\nWhile some Chemistry departments have been early adopters in using (Gen)AI in chemistry teaching, we are aware of others that are yet to incorporate (Gen)AI into their curriculum. This workshop will therefore provide case study examples while also providing opportunities for wider discussion on the topic.
